Triangle problem

By starting at the top of the triangle and moving only to one of the two adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 30.

        5
      9  6
    4   6  8

0 7 1 5
8 3 1 1 2

i.e. 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 + 3 = 30
Write a web app to calculate the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt, a text file containing a triangle with 100 rows. The following requirements should be met:
[x] Must be written in ReactJS/NextJS
[x] Must have a UX to accept any arbitrary triangle file (like the one linked above)
[x] Once the file is loaded, the solution should be visualized in the render of the triangle on the screen.
[] Extra points for making the solution animated as the solution is formed.
[x] Include a GitHub Actions workflow to build and run the unit tests every time a Pull Request is submitted on the main branch
[] Create your solution as a GitHub repository and share (1) the repo and (2) the URL to a published/online version of the app.
[] Send them via email to eydel.rivero@supermean.com and michel.triana@supermean.com with the subject [YourName-T:123456], replacing 123456 with the maximum sum for the triangle provided in the link above.
